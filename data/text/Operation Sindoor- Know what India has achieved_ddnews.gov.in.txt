Operation Sindoor: Know what India has achieved
4–5 minutes

In the early hours of May 7, India launched “Operation Sindoor,” a bold and calculated military response to the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that claimed the lives of 26 civilians, mostly tourists. The operation, which involved deep strikes inside Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK), marked a significant shift in India’s counterterrorism doctrine.

Destruction of Terror Launchpads

India successfully destroyed nine high-value terror launchpads linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hizbul Mujahideen. These locations were identified as key training and operational hubs for attacks against India.

Deep Strikes into Pakistan’s Mainland

Operation Sindoor broke conventional norms by targeting locations deep within Pakistan’s mainland, including strategic zones like Punjab province and Bahawalpur — areas once considered untouchable. By doing so, India discarded the old distinction between terrorists and their state sponsors, treating both as legitimate targets. This demonstrated that no part of Pakistan would be considered safe if terror emanates from its soil.

Assertion of a Red Line

The response signaled a doctrinal shift in India’s strategy, establishing that state-sponsored terrorism would now invite targeted, visible, and proportional retaliation. Operation Sindoor underlined a new red line that Pakistan could no longer ignore.

Exposing Pakistan’s Air Defence Vulnerabilities

Indian forces, including Rafale jets equipped with SCALP missiles and HAMMER bombs, executed the strikes with pinpoint accuracy. The 23-minute mission exposed significant gaps in Pakistan’s air defence network, which was either bypassed or neutralised. Not a single Indian asset was lost in the operation.

Demonstration of Robust Air Defence Capabilities

India also proved its robust air defence capabilities at home. The Akashteer Air Defence System played a key role in intercepting hundreds of Pakistani drones and missiles, and is now positioned as a serious global export contender.

Precision Without Escalation

While India’s actions were assertive, they were not escalatory. No civilian or general military infrastructure was targeted — only identified terror assets. The response followed India’s long-standing doctrine of zero tolerance toward terrorism, coupled with a clear effort to avoid civilian casualties.

Elimination of Key Terrorist Operatives

Several high-value terrorist operatives were eliminated, including individuals on India’s most-wanted list. The leadership of multiple terror modules was dismantled in one night.

Damage to Pakistan’s Military Establishment

In retaliation to Pakistan’s drone and missile attacks on May 9–10, India carried out strikes on 11 Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan, Rafiqi, Murid, Sukkur, Sialkot, Pasrur, Chunian, Sargodha, Skardu, Bholari, and Jacobabad. These strikes reportedly destroyed 20 percent of Pakistan’s air force infrastructure. Among the dead was Pakistan’s squadron leader Usman Yousuf.

Tri-Service Coordination

The operation showcased seamless tri-service coordination between the Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Indian Navy’s deployment in the Arabian Sea kept Pakistan’s naval assets pinned near the coast, while weapon drills ensured full operational preparedness at sea.

Global Message Sent

Globally, the operation sent a strong message. In contrast to previous conflicts where India was urged to show restraint, this time the world’s leading powers largely expressed support for India’s right to defend its citizens and territory.

Changing the Narrative on Kashmir

Operation Sindoor also helped shift the narrative around Kashmir. The strikes were viewed not through the prism of the bilateral dispute, but as part of a legitimate response to terrorism. For the first time, the Kashmir issue was effectively de-hyphenated from India’s right to act against terror.

India’s message was unambiguous: those who shelter terrorists will no longer be safe. The response to Pahalgam was not just retaliation — it was a declaration of resolve.
